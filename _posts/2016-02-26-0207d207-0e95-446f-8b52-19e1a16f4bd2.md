Who else here knows what astral projection is? Have you experienced it or do you know someone who experienced it before? I believe it is not something ordinary people should practice.But before we go to further details, let us first know what astral projection is. Based on my research, astral projection or astral travel is an interpretation of an out-of-body experience (OBE) that assumes the existence of an "astral body" separate from the physical body and capable of travelling outside it. Sounds interesting right?
